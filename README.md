Moderner Beta is a fork of [b3spectacled](https://github.com/b3spectacled)'s [Modern Beta](https://github.com/b3spectacled/modern-beta-fabric). It originally started as a pull request for the original Modern Beta to add in world generation from Beta 1.8 to 1.6.4, however due to b3spectacled's inactivity it has become more of its own thing.

## Features
In addition to everything in Modern Beta...
- Support for NeoForge and Minecraft Forge in addition to Fabric
- World generation from Beta 1.8 up to Release 1.6 with experimental support for 1.7 to 1.17 generation
- Additional world generation from Infdev 20100325, Classic 0.0.14a_08 and Beta 1.1
- Fixed surface rules for Beta Vanilla and 1.12.2 presets
- Highly customisable biome layout for Beta 1.8+ versions
